Situated right on the Mediterranean Sea in Beaulieu-sur-Mer, sits the idyllic Villa Kerylos. Built in the early 20th Century, the greek inspired property is an architects dream and the perfect hide away for those wanting to escape the bright lights of Nice and Monaco.

 From intricately hand-painted ceilings, to beautifully designed mosaic flooring, each room possesses it’s own unique characteristics dedicated to various greek gods and classical heroes. Adorned with various types of marble, The Andron or ‘Mens Lounge’ is particularly impressive, mirroring similar aspects of idesign and ambiance to that of the ‘Palais de Versailles.' The interiors of this building truly define the meaning of luxury although it never feels ’too much’ in my opinion.

The flourishing gardens provide an equally beautiful and tranquil setting with views of the Mediterranean coastline stretching from Saint Jean Cap Ferrat to Cap d’Ail. Its one of those places where you could just sit, take a book and read all day without a care in the world. There are also numerous art exhibitions held throughout the year located in the Gallery of Antiques below the villa itself, perfectly curated to intertwine both modern and ancient works of art. Whatever the time of year, this is somewhere you’ll undoubtedly feel calm and inspired.
